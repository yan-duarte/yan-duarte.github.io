This is the first assignment for the Data Analysis Capstone from Data Analysis and Interpretation course ministered by Wesleyan University.

In this assignment, we have to make a title and an introduction to the Research Question.

Within the innumerable possibilities of datasets, I ended up being in doubt between two possible works

## **Tuberculosis research**

### Title

Relationship between the importance that individuals, governments and companies give to health and the success rate in the treatment of tuberculosis.

### Research question

How does the relation of the importance give to health of individuals, governments and companies influence the success rate in the treatment of tuberculosis?

### Hypothesis

If parolees have a better relation with the family member then they will be less likely to have increased substance abuse, involvement in crime and re-arrests.

If parolee’s friends are engaged in the less deviant act then parolee’s will be less likely to have increased substance abuse, involvement in crime and re-arrests.

### Motivation/Rationale


### Potential Implications

### Dataset and variables
To make this research, I decide to use the QOG Standard Dataset 2016 [[1]][ref_01]. This dataset consists of approximately 2500 variables from more than 100 data sources.
There was used 10 variables in total from four differents database:
  
  - Environmental Performance Data (EPI) [[2]][ref_02];
  - International Monetary Fund (IMF) [[3]][ref_03];
  - Worldbank - World Development Indicators (WDI) [[4]][ref_04];
  - World Economic Forum (WEF) [[5]][ref_05].
  
The response variable is the Tuberculosis treatment success rate (% of new cases).  
  
For explanatory variables, for government importance give to health I considered the variables:

  - Health expenditure per capita, PPP (constant 2011 international dollar)
  - Water and Sanitation: Access to Drinking Water and Access to Sanitation
  - Air Quality: Household Air Quality, Air Pollution - Average Exposure to PM2.5 and Air Pollution
  
for individuals importance give to health, the variables:

  - Smoking prevalence, females (% of adults)
  - Smoking prevalence, males (% of adults)

and for companies importance give to health, the variable:

  - Business impact of tuberculosis
  
There are 3 more variables that can be applied in the research:

  - Tuberculosis case detection rate (%, all forms)
  - Incidence of tuberculosis (per 100,000 people)
  - GDP (PPP) (share of world total) (%)
