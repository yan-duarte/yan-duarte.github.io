### STEP 1: Choose a data set that you would like to work with.
After I have analyzed the data set from the suggested codebooks, I decided to use the [Gapminder][link_gapminder]. I have chosen this dataset because it has subjects that is related to my areas of interests.

### STEP 2: Identify a specific topic of interest.
There is a lot of different subjects in Gapminder but the one that most drew me attention was the _"Breast cancer, new cases per 100,000 women"_ because this disease was my subject of study in my master degree.

### STEP 3: Prepare a codebook of your own.
The codebook was created based on Gapminder codebook. It contains all the variables details for both my topics.

|   Variable Name   |      Description of Indicator   |  Main Source |
|:----:|:----------------------------------------:|:----:|
| breastCancerAll   | Total number of new female cases of breast cancer during the 2002 year. | IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) |
| breastCancer100th | Number of new cases of breast cancer in 100,000 female residents during the 2002 year. | IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) |
| meanSugarPerson   | Mean of the food consumption quantity (grams per person and day) of sugar and sweeters between years 1961 and 2002 | FAO modified |
| meanFoodPerson    | Mean of the total supply of food (kilocalories / person & day) available in a country, divided by the population and 365 (the number of days in the year) between the years | FAO modified |
| meanCholesterol   | The average of the mean TC (Total Cholesterol) of the female population, counted in mmol per L; (calculated as if each country has the same age composition as the world | MRC-HPA Centre for Environment and Health |

### STEP 4: Identify a second topic that you would like to explore in terms of its association with your original topic.
