This is the last assignment for the machine learning for data analysis course, fourth from a series of five courses from Data Analysis and Interpretation ministered by Wesleyan University.
The previous content you can see [here](https://yan-duarte.github.io/tags/).

In this assignment, we have to run a k-means Cluster Analysis.

My response variable is the number of new cases of breast cancer in 100,000 female residents during the year 2002 (breastCancer100th).
My first explanatory variable is the mean of sugar consumption quantity (grams per person and day) between the years 1961 and 2002.
My second explanatory variable is the mean of the total supply of food (kilocalories / person & day) available in a country, divided by the population and 365 between the years 1961 and 2002.
My third explanatory variable is the average of the mean TC (Total Cholesterol) of the female population, counted in mmol per L; (calculated as if each country has the same age composition as the world population) between the years 1980 and 2002.

All variables used in this assignment are quantitative.
