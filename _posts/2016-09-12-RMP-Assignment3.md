This is the second assignment for the regression modeling practice course, third from a series of five courses from Data Analysis and Interpretation ministered from Wesleyan University.
The previous content you can see [here](https://yan-duarte.github.io/tags/).

In this assignment, we have to Test a Basic Linear Regression Model with our data.

To do that, one management with the data must be done. As both explanatory and response variable are quantitative the only modification to do is to center in the mean the explanatory variable by subtracting the mean from the data values, then the value 0 will be the mean. (The mean value of the explanatory variable is 76.2383942414).
