This is the third assignment for the regression modeling practice course, third from a series of five courses from Data Analysis and Interpretation ministered from Wesleyan University.
The previous content you can see [here](https://yan-duarte.github.io/tags/).

In this assignment, we have to Test a Basic Multiple Regression Model with our data.

For my response variable is the number of new cases of breast cancer in 100,000 female residents during the year 2002.
My explanatory variable is the mean of sugar consumption quantity (grams per person and day) between the years 1961 and 2002.

To make the assignment of this week I have add two other explanatory variables:
  
  -
  -

Note that all my explanatories variables are quantitative, thus I must center the variables by subtracting the mean from the data values, then the value 0 will be very close to the mean. 

The complete program for this assignment can be download [here](https://yan-duarte.github.io/archives/rmp-assignment3.py) and the dataset [here](https://yan-duarte.github.io/archives/separatedData.csv).
