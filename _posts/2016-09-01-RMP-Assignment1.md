This is the first assignment for the regression modeling practice course, third from a series of five courses from Data Analysis and Interpretation ministered from Wesleyan University.
The previous content you can see [here](https://yan-duarte.github.io/tags/).

In this assignment, we have to describe the sample, the data collection procedure, and how do I manage my data.


## **Sample**

The sample is from GAPMINDER a non-profit venture promoting sustainable global development and achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals by increased use and understanding of statistics and other information about social, economic and environmental development at local, national and global levels.

GAPMINDER uses data from others data providers, I choose to use the variable number of new cases of breast cancer in 100,000 female residents during the years provide by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).

The incidence of new breast cancer data was compiled by Gapminder using data from [IARC GLOBOCAN 2002 (estimates for 2002)](http://globocan.iarc.fr/) and [IARC CI5 (Cancer Incidence in 5 Continents - Vol. I to VIII)](http://ci5.iarc.fr/) .

It has the incidence of new breast cancer data since the year of 1953 to 2002 from 174 different countries where only the year of 2002 has the complete data of all countries.

Another variable used was the food consumption quantity (grams per person and day) of sugar and sweeters. GAPMINDER compiled the data from Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ([FAO](http://faostat.fao.org/)). Food supply data is some of the most important data in FAOSTAT. In fact, this data is the basis for estimation of global and national undernourishment assessment, when it is combined with parameters and other data sets.
This data has been the foundation of food balance sheets ever since they were first constructed. The data is accessed by both business and governments for economic analysis and policy setting, as well as being used by the academic community. 

The provided data is from 1961 until 2004 of 156 different countries.


## **Procedure**

The incidence of new breas case data were collected with the amount of the information available for each country. In theory, there are as many methods as countries, and because of the variety and the complexity of these methods, an overall quality score for the incidence and mortality estimates combined is almost impossible to establish.
However an alphanumeric scoring system which independently describes the availability of incidence and mortality data has been established at the country level. The combined score is presented together with the estimates for each country with an aim of providing a broad indication of the robustness of the estimation. 

Availability of incidence data:

  A. High quality* national data or high quality regional (coverage greater than 50%).
  B. High quality* regional (coverage between 10% and 50%).
  C. High quality* regional (coverage lower than 10%).
  D. National data (rates).
  E. Regional data (rates).
  F. Frequency data.
  G. No data.

The period of this data collection was from 1953 until 2002.

For the sugar consumption per person and day, the data 


## **Measures**

Since most of the cancer registries were not national level, we only picked several countries and territories for comparisons: Canada, Costa Rica, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Hong Kong, Iceland, New Zealand, Norway, Slovak Republic, Slovenia and Sweden. A direct combination has been done because IARC CI5 time series data stops in year 1997 and all 2002 data comes from IARC GLOBOCAN 2002 data.	



Lifetime major depression (i.e. those experienced in the past 12 months and prior to the
past 12 months) was assessed using the NIAAA, Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated
Disabilities Interview Schedule – DSM-IV (AUDADIS-IV) (Grant et al., 2003; Grant, Harford,
Dawson, & Chou, 1995). The tobacco module of the AUDADIS-IV contains detailed
questions on the frequency, quantity, and patterning of tobacco use as well as symptom
criteria for DSM-IV nicotine dependence. Current smoking was evaluated through both
smoking frequency (“About how often did you usually smoke in the past year?”) coded
dichotomously to represent presence or absence of daily smoking, and quantity (“On the
days that you smoked in the last year, about how many cigarettes did you usually smoke?”),
a quantitative variable that ranged from 1 cigarette per day to 98 cigarettes per day
