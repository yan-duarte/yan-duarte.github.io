This is the second assignment for the regression modeling practice course, third from a series of five courses from Data Analysis and Interpretation ministered from Wesleyan University.

In this assignment, we have to Test a Basic Linear Regression Model with our data.

To do that, one management with the data must be done. As both explanatory and response variable are quantitative the only modification to do is to center in the mean the explanatory variable by subtracting the mean from the data values, then the value 0 will be the mean.


## **Test a Basic Linear Regression Model**



The assignment:

1) If you have a categorical explanatory variable, make sure one of your categories is coded "0" and generate a frequency table for this variable to check your coding. If you have a quantitative explanatory variable, center it so that the mean = 0 (or really close to 0) by subtracting the mean, and then calculate the mean to check your centering.

2) Test a linear regression model and summarize the results in a couple of sentences. Make sure to include statistical results (regression coefficients and p-values) in your summary.
